# Simple Decision Program (Using Python)

This is just a basic Python project I made to practice using `if`, `else`, and `input()` functions. 
It asks how you're feeling and gives a simple reply based on your answer. It's not real AI,
but it's a good way to start understanding how logic and decision-making works in code.

## What it does

- Asks the user about their mood  
- Uses simple conditions (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to respond  
- Shows how decision logic works with basic input

---

## What I used

- Python
- if/else conditions
- input/output
- Planning how a program thinks step-by-step

---

## What I'm learning next

- Functions (to organize code better)
- Loops (for repeating actions)
- Lists/arrays (to store data)
- Making more flexible, real-use tools
